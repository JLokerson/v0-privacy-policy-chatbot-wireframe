    <h1>Data Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This policy describes the information we process to support PhotoShare and other products and features offered by
      PhotoShare (PhotoShare Products or Products). You can find additional tools and information in the PhotoShare
      Settings.
    </p>

    <h2>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>
      To provide the PhotoShare Products, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect
      depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access and delete information we collect by visiting the
      PhotoShare Settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Things you and others do and provide.</h3>
    <h4>Information and content you provide.</h4>
    <p>
      We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when
      you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include
      information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a
      file was created. It can also include what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do
      things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems
      automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for
      the purposes described below.
    </p>

    <h4>Data with special protections:</h4>
    <p>
      You can choose to provide information in your PhotoShare profile fields about your religious views, political
      views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,
      philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of your
      country.
    </p>

    <h4>Networks and connections.</h4>
    <p>
      We collect information about the people, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you interact
      with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also
      collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or
      call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for
      the other purposes listed below.
    </p>

    <h4>Your usage.</h4>
    <p>
      We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the
      features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and
      duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what
      posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you use features
      like our camera.
    </p>

    <h4>Information about transactions made on our Products.</h4>
    <p>
      If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game
      or make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information,
      such as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account and authentication information;
      and billing, shipping and contact details.
    </p>

    <h4>Things others do and information they provide about you.</h4>
    <p>
      We also receive and analyze content, communications and information that other people provide when they use our
      Products. This can include information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a
      message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.
    </p>

    <h3>Device Information</h3>
    <p>
      As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other
      web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different
      devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better
      personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as
      your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone
      on a different device.
    </p>

    <p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions,
        battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and
        plugins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as
        whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from
        bots).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or
        accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to PhotoShare Products associated with the
        same device or account).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons,
        and cell towers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn
        on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language,
        time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices
        that are nearby or on your network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information from partners.</h3>
    <p>
      Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through PhotoShare Business Tools they use,
      including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), PhotoShare Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the PhotoShare
      pixel. These partners provide information about your activities off of our Products—including information about
      your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or
      not you have an account or are logged into our Products. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell
      us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive
      information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the
      rights to provide us with your information.
    </p>

    <h2>II. How do we use this information?</h2>
    <p>
      We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the
      PhotoShare Products. Here's how:
    </p>

    <h3>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including
      your ads and feed) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be interested in or topics you
      may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,
      we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you and
      others; how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and
      interested in on and off our Products.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information across PhotoShare Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your
        activities on different PhotoShare Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on
        all PhotoShare Products you use, wherever you use them.

      <li>
        <strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as your current
        location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide,
        personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve
        our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and
        features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information
        about your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content
        that we show you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads
      you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and
      services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites,
      apps, and services.
    </p>

    <h3>Promote safety, integrity and security.</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam
      and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of
      PhotoShare Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our
      terms or policies, or to detect when someone needs help.
    </p>

    <h3>Communicate with you.</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and
      let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
    </p>

    <h3>Research and innovate for social good.</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support
      research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health
      and well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>III. How is this information shared?</h2>
    <p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>

    <h3>Sharing on PhotoShare Products</h3>
    <h4>People and accounts you share and communicate with</h4>
    <p>
      When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when
      you post on PhotoShare, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or
      a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use PhotoShare to communicate with people or businesses, those
      people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our
      Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This
      includes your PhotoShare username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public
      profile on PhotoShare; and content you share on a public PhotoShare account or any other public forum. You, other
      people using PhotoShare, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products.
      Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search
      engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our
      Products.
    </p>

    <h4>Content others share or reshare about you</h4>
    <p>
      You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can
      choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you
      shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can
      download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual
      reality experiences.
    </p>

    <h4>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</h4>
    <p>
      When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our
      Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your
      PhotoShare friends or use a PhotoShare Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can
      receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website
      on PhotoShare.
    </p>

    <h4>New owner.</h4>
    <p>
      If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your
      information to the new owner.
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</h3>
    <p>
      We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use PhotoShare Business
      Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to
      people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict
      restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we
      share information with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong> We provide aggregated statistics and insights that
        help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, pages, videos and
        other content on and off the PhotoShare Products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertisers.</strong> We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and
        how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you unless you give us
        permission.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Measurement partners.</strong> We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to
        provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong> When you subscribe to receive premium
        content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public
        information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the
        transaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong> We provide information and content to vendors and service
        providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our
        Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Researchers and academics.</strong> We also provide information and content to research partners and
        academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong> We share information with law enforcement or in response to
        legal requests in certain circumstances.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</h2>
    <p>
      We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your PhotoShare
      Settings.
    </p>

    <p>
      We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and PhotoShare Products, or until your
      account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the
      nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For
      example, when you search for something on PhotoShare, you can access and delete that query from within your search
      history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your
      government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise
      stated.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you
      won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your
      account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the
      Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the PhotoShare
      Settings.
    </p>

    <h2>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h2>
    <p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief
        that the law requires us to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the
        Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves
        (including our rights, property or Products), you or others; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Information we receive about you can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a
      legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
      policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for
      at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
    </p>

    <h2>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</h2>
    <p>
      We share information globally, both internally within PhotoShare, and externally with our partners and with those
      you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be
      transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where
      you live for the purposes as described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</h2>
    <p>
      We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy
      before you choose to continue using our Products.
    </p>

    <h2>IX. How to contact us with questions</h2>
    <p>
      You can learn more about how privacy works on PhotoShare. If you have questions about this policy, you can contact
      us.
