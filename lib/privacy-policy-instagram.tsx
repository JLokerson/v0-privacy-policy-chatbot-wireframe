    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective date: January 19, 2013</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to PhotoShare ("PhotoShare," "we," "us" or "our"). PhotoShare provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for
      you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look
      and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect
      information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with
      PhotoShare services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including
      photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This
      means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly
      available through the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>

    <h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a PhotoShare account.</li>
      <li>
        Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number).
        This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on PhotoShare.
      </li>
      <li>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
      <li>
        Communications between you and PhotoShare. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account
        verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not
        opt out of Service-related e-mails.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Finding your friends on PhotoShare:</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with PhotoShare accounts either
      through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and
      usernames on PhotoShare.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then PhotoShare will access your
        contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using PhotoShare.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to
        set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide
        to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on PhotoShare then simply type a
        name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.
      </li>
    </ul>
